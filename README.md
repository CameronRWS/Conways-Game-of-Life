# COMS 327 - Project 1 Part B
This part of the project is to expand on what was written in part A but using a structure to represent the 1DCA and also now simulate the 1DCA.

## Features Implemented

1. Initialize a 1D Cellular Automata (1DCA)
2. Display a 1DCA
3. Set the value of a specific cell in the 1DCA
4. Create a 1DCA
5. Simulate 1 step of a 1DCA
6. Define a rule for simulating a 1DCA
7. Prompt user for input related to simulating a 1DCA and simulating it.

## Known Errors and Issues

- N/A
